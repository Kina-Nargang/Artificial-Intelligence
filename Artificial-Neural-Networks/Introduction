Introduction :

Use ANN model to predict if the customer with the following informations will leave the bank: 

  Geography: France
  Credit Score: 600
  Gender: Male
  Age: 40 years old
  Tenure: 3 years
  Balance: $60000
  Number of Products: 2
  Does this customer have a credit card ? Yes
  Is this customer an Active Member: Yes
  Estimated Salary: $50000
  
 So should we say goodbye to that customer ?
  
 Dataset : Churn_Modelling.csv
 
 Part1: 
    Get train dataset and test dataset. Convert categorical data.
 
 Part2: 
    Uesd GridSearch to find the best parameters and best accuracy.
        best parameters: {'epochs': 500, 'batch_size': 48, 'optimizer': 'rmsprop'}
        best accuracy: 0.850625
 
 Part3:
    Build ANN model with the best parameters and predict.
    
 Confusion Matrix:
    array([[1538,   57],
       [ 253,  152]], dtype=int64)
 
 Prediction output : False (Means customer will not leave the bank)
